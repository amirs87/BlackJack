# BlackJack-
The code provides a basic simulation of the Blackjack card game, where a player competes against an automated dealer to achieve a card total closest to 21 without exceeding it. Players can "hit" to draw cards or "stand" to finalize their hand, with outcomes like Blackjack and "bust" accounted for. After each round, players can replay or exit.
